# Hi, I'm Jerra!

I am a data analyst with an interest in sustainable tourism and public policy. 

I grew up in South Lake Tahoe, a ski town in Northern California that attracts millions of tourists annually. While tourism sustains the local economy, it also brings challenges like overcrowding, infrastructure strain, traffic, and environmental degradation. Witnessing these tradeoffs firsthand sparked my interest in understanding and addressing complex societal problems.

I pursued a B.A. in Economics and Sociology at UC Santa Barbara to explore solutions to issues like those in my hometown. Courses in econometrics taught me quantitative analysis and data interpretation, while classes in sociological theory and research methods provided a foundation for analyzing social structures and behaviors. As a research assistant, I applied this knowledge to a sociological study on mass shootings in America, deepening my understanding of how data can address real-world problems.

Now pursuing a Master’s in Computational Social Science at UC Berkeley, I am learning to combine social science insights with technical skills in Python, R, and SQL to perform exploratory data analysis, causal inference, and machine learning. With firsthand experience in tackling challenges such as balancing tourism with local needs, I am driven by the belief that data can empower communities to navigate complex issues and create sustainable, positive change.

For more details about projects I have worked on, they are described below. 

### Analytical Skills 
- **Data Processing and Analytics:** Jupyter Notebook, R Studio, Pandas, Numpy, tidyverse.
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, ggplot2.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, and Clusterization.
- **Programming:** Python, R, SQL.

## Projects
- [NLP on CA School Board Policies](https://github.com/jerramcl/school-board-NLP)

    I analyzed environmental school board policies from 700+ California school districts by extracting text from PDFs using Python (fitz, pdf2image,  pytesseract) and cleaning the data with   regex and NLP tools. Using regression analysis, semantic similarity, and topic modeling, I explored whether specific policy language correlates with climate action. I created visualizations—including graphs and word clouds—to highlight key patterns and developed a scalable, replicable framework for qualitative policy analysis. The goal was to understand if school board policy language affects implentation of climate friendly action on campuses across California.

- [Investments in Public Transportation on Property Values](https://github.com/jerramcl/transportation-project/tree/main)

    I analyzed the impact of the BART Warm Springs extension on local property values using data from the Zillow API, U.S. Census, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employing an OLS regression model, I accounted for multicollinearity in time-series data and corrected for heteroskedasticity to improve the model’s reliability.

- [Gender Disparities within the Workplace](https://github.com/jerramcl/women-at-work/tree/main)
  
    This project investigates gender disparities in salaries and leadership representation within the business sector, focusing on whether men earn more than women and if women are underrepresented in leadership roles. By analyzing variables such as salary, gender, highest degree type, occupation group, and leadership roles, the study explores wage gaps and differences in representation to identify potential barriers to gender equity. The findings aim to provide actionable insights into addressing systemic inequalities and promoting equal opportunities in the workplace.

- [Displacement Risk in LA and SF Counties](https://github.com/jerramcl/rent-burden)

   This project compares displacement risk between Los Angeles and San Francisco counties by analyzing factors such as rent burden, health outcomes, and demographic vulnerability. Using data from the CDC, U.S. Census, and other sources, the study evaluates median rent costs, chronic illness prevalence, and at-risk populations, including renters, homeowners, racial groups, seniors, and children. Findings indicate that LA County faces a greater risk of displacement due to higher rent burden, poorer health outcomes, and a larger proportion of marginalized populations.
