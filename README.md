# Hi, I'm Jerra!

I am a data analyst with an interest in sustainable tourism and public policy to combat climate change. 

I grew up in South Lake Tahoe, a ski town in Northern California that attracts millions of tourists annually. While tourism sustains the local economy, it also brings challenges like overcrowding, infrastructure strain, traffic, and environmental degradation. Witnessing these tradeoffs firsthand sparked my interest in understanding and addressing complex societal problems.

I pursued a B.A. in Economics and Sociology at UC Santa Barbara to explore solutions to issues like those in my hometown. Courses in econometrics taught me quantitative analysis and data interpretation, while classes in sociological theory and research methods provided a foundation for analyzing social structures and behaviors. As a research assistant, I applied this knowledge to a sociological study on mass shootings in America, deepening my understanding of how data can address real-world problems.

Now pursuing a Master’s in Computational Social Science at UC Berkeley, I am learning to combine social science insights with technical skills in Python, R, and SQL to perform exploratory data analysis, causal inference, and machine learning. With firsthand experience in tackling challenges such as balancing tourism with local needs, I am driven by the belief that data can empower communities to navigate complex issues and create sustainable, positive change.

For more details about projects I have worked on, they are described below. 

### Analytical Skills 
- **Data Processing and Analytics:** Jupyter Notebook, R Studio, Pandas, Numpy, tidyverse.
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, ggplot2.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, and Clusterization.
- **Programming:** Python, R, SQL.

## Projects
- [NLP on CA School Board Policies](https://github.com/jerramcl/school-board-NLP)

  I analyzed environmental school board policies from 700+ California school districts by extracting text from PDFs using Python (fitz, pdf2image, pytesseract) and cleaning the data with   regex and NLP tools. Using regression analysis, semantic similarity, and topic modeling, I explored whether specific policy language correlates with climate action. I created         
  visualizations—including graphs and word clouds—to highlight key patterns and developed a scalable, replicable framework for qualitative policy analysis. The goal was to understand if    school board policy language affects implentation of climate friendly action on campuses across California.

- [Investments in Public Transportation on Property Values](https://github.com/jerramcl/transportation-project/tree/main)

  I analyzed the impact of the BART Warm Springs extension on local property values using data from the Zillow API, U.S. Census, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employing an OLS         
  regression model, I accounted for multicollinearity in time-series data and corrected for heteroskedasticity to improve the model’s reliability.
